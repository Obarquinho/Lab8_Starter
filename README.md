<br> I worked on this, Ryan Vanny
1. I would fit the automated tests in a Github action that would run whenever code is pushed, because if the tests were automated, they would make sure that each change to the code is in compliance with preset tests.
2. no
3. You should use E2E testing for this case, because it involves user input with UI, which is what E2E testing is used for.
4. Yes, it should test to see if the max length is accounted for, which a unit test could cover for, because you could expect an inputed length to return false from a function, so you want ot see its output.
